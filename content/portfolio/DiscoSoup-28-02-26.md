The Disco Soup is a global initiative born within the Slow Food movement, created to raise awareness about food waste by turning leftover ingredients into tasty dishes — all in a joyful, communal atmosphere.

Our event keeps that same spirit alive: a relaxed space where you can cook, dance, and connect while using unsold vegetables sourced directly from local farmers.

🗓️ When: Saturday, 28 February
🕒 Time: 5 p.m. – 9 p.m.
📍 Where: Teranga – 35, Av. de la Libération, 3850 Schifflange
